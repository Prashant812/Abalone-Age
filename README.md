# Abalone-Age
I have used data file abalone.csv. Abalones are marine snails. The dataset has been prepared 
with the aim of making age predictions easier. Customarily, the age of abalone is determined by cutting 
the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope. But it 
is a tedious and time-consuming task. Therefore, other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are 
used to predict age. So, In order to choose the best regression model to predict Abalone's age, The Regression model like
Linear Regression, Multivariate Linear Regression Model, Simple Nonlinear Regression Model, Multivariate Nonlinear Regression Model are used, In which
Multivariate Nonlinear Regression Model for p = 5 found to be better than others as it has the least RMSE values than the other models 
for both training as well test data in predicting no. of rings in Abalone.
